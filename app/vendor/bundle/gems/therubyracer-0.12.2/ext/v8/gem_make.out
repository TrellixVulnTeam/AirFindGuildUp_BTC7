/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/libv8-3.11.8.13/ext/libv8/location.rb:50:in `configure': You have chosen to use the version of V8 found on your system (Libv8::Location::System::NotFoundError)
and *not* the one that is bundle with the libv8 rubygem. However,
it could not be located. please make sure you have a version of
v8 that is compatible with 3.11.8.13 installed. You may
need to special --with-v8-dir options if it is in a non-standard
location
